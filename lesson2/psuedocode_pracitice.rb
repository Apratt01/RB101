# Start - create a method that returns the sum of integers
# Define a method with 2 parameters
# the method should add the 2 arguments together and return the sum
# Set two variables to 2 numbers to pass into the method
# Call the method with the 2 variables

# Start - creat a method that takes an array of strings, & returns a string
# that is all those strings concatenated together
# Set a variable to an array of strings.
# Define a method with one parameter
# The method shoul use the .each method to iterate through the array
# Set a local variable to string value
# Push each iteration into the local varialbe to return the concantenated string
# Call the method and pass the array into the method.

# A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every
# other element from the original array, starting the 1st element.
# set a variable to an array
# define a method with one parameter
# create a local variable for an array
# use the method each_index and check if the index is even or odd
# if even then push to the local variable
# end the method

# a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character 
# in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 
# 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the 
# given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

# Start
# Define method with 2 parameters, 1 for the string 1 for the character
# Set a local variable within the method to count the number of times a letter 
# exists.
# Use each_with_index to iterate through the string and return both the character
# and the index
# create a comparison that checks to see if the letter matches the given letter
# If ture then add 1 to the count variable for every time #
# create a compariosn to evaluate if count is 3
# if true return the index
# if never true, return nil
